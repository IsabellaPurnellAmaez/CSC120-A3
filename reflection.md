Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
None
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to TA hours (9/25), (9/28), and (9/30)
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I like it a lot but the syntax is very different from python and since I had never used Java before I felt like I was cosntantly learning things I didn't know. I definitely can see why java and object oriented programming is useful which is cool because I had never really thought about how programming languages differ before. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
All of the methods for strings and lists and dictionaries from python still exist in Java but are writteen so differently. There were a lot of times where I knew what I wanted my code to do but had no clue how to write it or I would try and it wouldn't work and I would have no clue why. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Go to tutoring. The tutors were really helpful in debugging code and explaining to me why certain things didn't work which was really helpful in learning the language.
